My name is Penny Bryant, and I am the Director of Student and Academic Support Services for Lindenwood University in St. Charles, MO (suburb of St. Louis). I am originally from Hershey, PA. but have lived in Missouri for a long time. I have no previous web application experience and am expecting to learn as much as possible.

I have two grown sons. One who is the Assistant Director of Communications for Kennesaw State University. The other is the Director of Digital Media for the Chicago Fire (Major League Soccer Team).  I also have a forever fiancé (we may get married someday) who is a general contractor.  I am an avid college and pro football fan. I enjoy bike riding as much as possible. I am on the downside of my career. Within four years I hope to retire. I am excited to be in this class and learning to code. Building websites will be exciting! Welcome everyone!
