 <h3>My About Page</h3>
    <p>I am accomplished and energetic with a <em>solid history</em> of achievement in higher education. I am a <strong>motivated</strong> leader with strong organizational skills and the ability to prioritize responsibilities. I am able to manage large groups and am adaptable to change. <br>I am a loyal employee working long periods for two different universities. I began my working career as part owner of a video production company, creating promotional videos for various commercial entities in the St. Louis area. After several years, I transitioned to higher education beginning as an alumni coordinator, then to assistant registrar, to registrar and director of admissions. I am now the director of student and academic support services, mentoring students in various capacities. I have a Bachelor of Science in Mass Communications and Master of Science in Management from Lindenwood University and am currently working on my Ed.S. in education technology from the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p>
